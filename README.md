## Dependencies

Install either 'npm' or 'yarn'
`npm install`
`yarn`

## Scripts and Commands

Start development server:
`npm start`

Generate full static production build:
`npm run build`

## Functionality

The webpage features static content about my works, passions, and experience. Functional social links utilitizing Material Icons from Material UI link to my various socials.

## Possible Improvements

In the future I would like to implement more React hooks to make the site more interactive, like animations for certain components and reactive menus for displaying content. Additionally, I'd like to experiment with using Tailwind CSS to customize the styling of my site in a more personal and granular way.
